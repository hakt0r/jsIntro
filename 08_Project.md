## The Plan

    - Each groups has daily meetings, goals
    - Weekly or Daily sprints (milestone or goal within a certain timeframe)
    - Create a Trello Board (Todo, In Progress, To Verify, Done)
    - Pair programming for difficult Tasks, and on idle
        - The weaker Programmer executes
    - One of each groups will take the Role of the client / user
        - If a function is hard to use or understand, fix it
        - If the UI is ugly scream at the designer
